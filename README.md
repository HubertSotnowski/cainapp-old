# CAINAPP 2 BETA🚧


Welcome to CAINAPP 2.0!

In this version, CAIN's command interface can run completely off of discord!
However, this comes with some limitations, such as the fact that in a server without nitro, you are limited to a max file size of 8 mb.
The audio quality suffers as a result.

However, if you wish to run the GUI only to circumvent this, you can do that.

We have a few models for you to play with, such as

broken - hubert claims for this to be "epileptic" and to "try it"

stable - a stable model trained on vimeo90k

TVP_WIP-8E - fine for use, but we're still working out some things

Here are some examples!

broken

stable

TVP_WIP-8E

If you wish to support the project, you can donate to Hubert's patreon [here](https://www.patreon.com/hubert_)!
Hubert's dogecoin and dgb wallets are also listed in the code.

Cain is very fast compared to some other interpolation software, and where it really excels is in 8k interpolation, if you have a card that's up to that
